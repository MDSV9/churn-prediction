# Kaggle Competition Submission - Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset 
**IN PROGRESS**

## Overview
This repository contains my late submission for the Kaggle competition "Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset - Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 1." The goal of this competition is to predict whether a customer will continue with their bank account or close it (churn).

## Leaderboard Rank
- My post competition leaderboard rank: [Your rank]
- Date of submission: 2/22/2024

## Code and Notebooks
### Notebooks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

3. **Model Training:**
   - [Link to Model Training notebook]

### Code
- The `notebooks/` directory contains the code for my solution.

## Dependencies
- Main libraries and their versions used in this project.
  - **NumPy:** Version 1.23.5
  - **Pandas:** Version 1.5.3
  - **Matplotlib:** Version 3.7.0
  - **Seaborn:** Version 0.12.2
  - **Scikit-learn:** Version 1.2.0
  - **CatBoost:** Version 1.2

## Usage
The entire data analysis and modeling process, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to the final modeling steps, is well-documented in the Jupyter notebook. To reproduce or run the solution, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Binary Classification with a Bank Churn.ipynb`.

2. Execute each cell sequentially to replicate the analysis and model training.

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Future Work
Discuss potential improvements or additional steps that could be taken to enhance the model or address limitations.
